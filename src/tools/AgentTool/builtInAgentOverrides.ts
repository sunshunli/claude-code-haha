/**

 * Two constraints that are load-bearing, not stylistic:
 *
 *   - Never mutate in place, and only copy the entries that actually carry an
 *     override. Call sites such as resumeAgent hold references to the exported
 *     module constants, so untouched agents must come back with their original
 *     object identity.
 *   - Never wrap `getSystemPrompt`. serializeActiveAgent in the agents API
 *     branches on `getSystemPrompt.length === 0` to decide whether it can call
 *     the function with no arguments; CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE_AGENT declares one
 *     parameter and the other built-ins declare none. Any `(...args) => fn()`
 *     wrapper reports length 0 for all of them and the guide agent then
 *     destructures `undefined`. Spreading preserves both the reference and the
 *     arity.
