/**
 * Is Computer Use turned on by the user right now?
 *
 * Gates whether the `computer-use` skill exists at all. Guidance for operating
 * the user's desktop has no business appearing in the session of someone who
 * deliberately switched the feature off — that switch is the whole reason the
 * guidance lives in a skill instead of MCP server instructions, which would sit
 * in every prompt for as long as the server is connected.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose: skill registration decides visibility during startup
 * and per slash-menu render, where there is nowhere to await. The read is a
 * single small JSON file and is cached for a short window so an open menu does
 * not stat the disk on every keystroke.
 *
 * When the config cannot be read it follows the app-wide default rather than
 * hiding: the tools are registered on that same default, and guidance must
 * never be absent where the tools are present.
