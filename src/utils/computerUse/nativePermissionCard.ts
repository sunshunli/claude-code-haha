/**
 * Auto-present the native macOS permission card (`cu-helper request-access`)
 * when Computer Use is missing a TCC grant — so the user grants Accessibility /
 * Screen Recording through a guided card (open-the-right-pane + drag + live
 * status), never a shell command.
 *
 * Responsible-process note: this is spawned from the same CLI process that runs
 * the executor, so the card grants the SAME `cu-helper` binary that actually
 * performs injection/capture → the card's ✅ means Computer Use will really work.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget. Debounced (one card at a time) + cooled-down (don't re-pop
 * the instant the user dismisses it). No-op off macOS or when the binary isn't
 * built. Never throws — failures are logged and swallowed.
