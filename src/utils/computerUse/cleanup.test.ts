/**
 * Unit coverage for the turn-end overlay-hide wiring in
 * `cleanupComputerUseAfterTurn`. Driven entirely through the injected
 * `deps.overlayHide` seam — no real cu-helper daemon, no real lock file.
 *
 * Hermetic by construction: in a fresh test process the file-based CU lock was
 * never acquired, so `isLockHeldLocally()` (a zero-syscall module-state check)
 * returns false and the disk lock-release path is skipped. With an empty
 * `computerUseMcpState` the hidden-apps/unhide branch is also skipped. So the
 * ONLY observable side effect here is the injected overlayHide — which is
 * exactly what we want to assert on.
