// AppGuidance.swift — per-app Computer Use guidance for cu-helper.
//
// Two responsibilities, both keyed off the target app's bundle identifier:
//
//   1. `frameReliability(bundleId:)` — a coarse classifier returning
//      "high" | "medium" | "low". It tells the actuation layer how much it can
//      trust an element's reported on-screen frame (its global Quartz rect).
//      Native AppKit apps report pixel-accurate frames (high); Electron / custom
//      WebKit-drawn shells (Slack, Discord, WeChat, Feishu/Lark) frequently
//      report stale or zeroed frames (low), so coordinate clicks and the virtual
//      cursor anchor should defer to AX-index actuation and pasteboard input.
//
//   2. `instructions(bundleId:)` — returns the inner body of the
//      `<app_specific_instructions>` block that CommandRouter folds into
//      `AXTree.Result.appInstructions`, which the TS MCP server injects on the
//      first get_app_state of a session for that app (returns nil when we have
//      nothing app-specific to say, so the block is omitted entirely).
//
// IP note: the instruction *format* (H2 title / H3 topics / <Key> chord
// notation / friendly element ids / parallel-call encouragement) is the
// interop convention Codex established, but every word below is original to
// this project — none of it is copied from any reference corpus.
//
// @MainActor: matches the cu-helper AX contract (every AX-touching enum is
// main-actor isolated). These two entry points are pure string lookups today,
// but staying on the main actor keeps the door open for future snapshot-aware
// heuristics without re-annotating call sites.

    ## Safari Computer Use

    ### Orienting

    The toolbar (address field, reload, tab strip, back/forward) is reliable \
    native chrome. The page itself is a `web area` whose elements come and go as \
    the page renders, so re-run get_app_state after any navigation, page load, \
    or in-page action before trusting indices.

    ### Navigating

    Drive the address field rather than clicking links by coordinate. Focus it \
    with <cmd+l>, then `set_value` the destination — the field submits on its \
    own once focused, so you do not need a separate Return in most cases.

    Use <cmd+f> to find on-page text, <cmd+r> to reload, <cmd+t> for a new tab, \
    <cmd+w> to close one, and <cmd+shift+]> / <cmd+shift+[> to step through open \
    tabs. Prefer these chords over hunting for the matching toolbar button.

    ### Working with the page

    Click links and buttons by their element index, not by coordinate — the \
    page frame can shift between snapshots. When a link element renders as \
    `[label](url)`, clicking it follows the link.

    For long pages, scroll the `web area` by pages and re-snapshot after a big \
    jump; only a window's worth of content is described at a time. If a control \
    you expect is missing, the page may still be loading — re-run get_app_state \
    before changing approach instead of retrying the same click.

    ### Forms

    Use `set_value` on text fields when the field reports it is settable; that \
    is faster and more reliable than typing key by key. Use parallel tool calls \
    to fill several independent fields in one turn, then submit.

    /// Finder — a native AppKit app with strong AX coverage.
    private static let finderInstructions = """
    ## Finder Computer Use

    ### Selecting and opening items

    Sidebar entries and file rows are `row` elements. Selecting a row highlights \
    it; opening a folder or file takes a double click. After you open a folder \
    the visible file list is replaced, so re-run get_app_state before acting on \
    the new contents — the old indices no longer apply.

    Favourites, tags, and locations in the sidebar are also rows. Prefer \
    selecting them by index over clicking a coordinate in the sidebar.

    ### Navigating the hierarchy

    Use <cmd+shift+g> to open the "Go to Folder" sheet and `set_value` an \
    absolute path when tree navigation is noisy or the target is deep — this is \
    usually faster than expanding folders one level at a time. Use <cmd+up> to \
    go to the enclosing folder and <cmd+down> to open the selection.

    Switch view modes with <cmd+1> (icon), <cmd+2> (list), <cmd+3> (column), \
    and <cmd+4> (gallery). List and column views expose the cleanest row tree \
    for selection.

    ### Sheets and dialogs

    Open/Save panels and rename sheets appear as their own window and replace \
    the main Finder tree in the snapshot. When one is up, act on the sheet's \
    elements; do not assume the underlying window's indices are still valid.

    ### File operations

    Standard chords apply once items are selected: <cmd+c> / <cmd+v> to copy and \
    paste, <cmd+delete> to move to Trash, <Return> to rename, <space> for Quick \
    Look. Re-snapshot after any operation that changes the listing.

    /// Generic Electron / custom-shell apps (Slack, Discord, VS Code, WeChat,
    /// Feishu/Lark, …) — partial AX coverage and unreliable frames.
    private static let electronInstructions = """
    ## Custom-Shell App Computer Use

    This app draws its own interface (Electron or a similar custom renderer), so \
    its Accessibility tree is partial and reported element frames are often \
    stale or wrong. Work index-first and lean on keyboard shortcuts.

    ### What is and isn't visible

    Window chrome, the menu bar, and top-level navigation are usually present in \
    the tree, but the main content area — message lists, editors, chat panes — \
    may be missing or sparse. Run get_app_state often; only a slice of the UI is \
    described at any moment, and what you need may appear only after you focus \
    or scroll the right region.

    ### Acting reliably

    Prefer element index WHILE the tree still describes real controls — a \
    reported frame may point at the wrong place. But when get_app_state shows \
    only the window frame and menu bar, element handles cannot reach the \
    content at all: read the screenshot and pass explicit x and y. \
    When an action seems to do nothing, re-run get_app_state before retrying: \
    the change may have landed even though the tree had not yet refreshed. Do \
    not repeat a handle that already reported success without changing anything.

    Reach for keyboard chords first: <cmd+k> commonly opens a command or quick \
    switcher, <cmd+f> searches, and the app's own shortcuts are more dependable \
    than locating a button in a thin tree.

    ### Entering text

    Custom input fields can mangle character-by-character key injection. Prefer \
    `set_value` when the field reports it is settable; otherwise focus the field \
    first, then type. For longer text, paste-style entry is more reliable than \
    long key sequences. Send one line per turn and use parallel tool calls when \
    several independent fields need filling.
